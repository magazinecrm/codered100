how did i implement  notx
first install ords.
we faced issue cause java jdk path had to be mentioend
and also java had to be right jdk it had to be above version
7 and below verison 9
ords all apex users had to be checked if they were unlocked
and also password changed and all rights like resource and connect
to s hema.s

next we implemented simple acl 
and then we were able install ords
we followed contents from 
the image folder was put in ords folder 
and thigns got easily loaded

Next challenge was installing webnotification
here the acl had to be instaleld
npm start 
and right json file had to be changed
npm is started

Then package procedure is installed in the right schema 
after that you can install the package 
if acl is installed all things are easy like a breeze
I have put the acl scripts so thigns can be easier next time
